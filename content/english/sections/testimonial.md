    content: "The physical properties of corn consist of indicators such as grain color, grain shape,seed coat gloss, grain length,grain width,100-grain weight,grain size,grain uniformity,and firmness rate.The color of corn kernels includes three parts,seed coat,aleurone layer (rich in protein,also called protein layer) and endosperm.In most cases,the color of the endosperm of mature corn kernels is yellow or white,and the seed coat and aleurone layer are colorless and transparent.According to the color of corn kernels, there are three types of corn,yellow corn,white corn and mixed corn.According to the shape,hardness and different uses of corn kernels,corn is divided into ordinary corn (hard kernel type,intermediate type,dent type,hard horse type,horse hard type) and special corn (high lysine corn,high oil corn,sweet corn,popping corn,waxy corn) two types.The shape and size of corn vary depending on the variety.Generally,corn is 8-12mm long,7-10mm wide,and 3-7mm thick.If the corn grains are too different,it will be difficult to clean and crush the corn during processing."
